# openwrt-samba-nas-raspberrypi


This repository serves as a practical guide for repurposing a Raspberry Pi running OpenWrt into a network-accessible file storage system by utilizing the storage resources available to the device. The core aim is to make data stored on the SD card—or on any additional storage media connected to the Raspberry Pi accessible to other machines within the local network through the Samba (SMB/CIFS) file-sharing protocol. 

Rather than being limited to a dedicated data partition, the shared storage can take the form of a specific directory within the existing OpenWrt filesystem or reside on external media such as USB drives or external hard disks attached to the device. The initial focus is on accurately detecting the target storage device, selecting an appropriate filesystem location, and mounting it in a persistent and reliable manner within OpenWrt. Particular attention is given to ensuring that mounts survive system reboots and that file permissions and ownership are correctly configured for network access. Once the storage layer is established, the repository details the setup and configuration of Samba on OpenWrt, including share definitions, access control, and basic security considerations. Through this approach, the Raspberry Pi is converted into a compact, low-overhead file server capable of providing centralized storage services across a LAN, suitable for home networks, experimental environments, or embedded deployments.
